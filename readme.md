## Development

> Want to help make Tint even better?

Tint is developed using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) which enables writing native applications using JavaScript.

Pre-reqs:

- Node v5.0.x:

```shell
# On a mac with Homebrew:
brew install nvm

nvm install
nvm use
npm install
```

- Electron:

```shell
# Install electron
npm install --global electron
```

Don't install electron-prebuild! Please see [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41574586/what-is-the-difference-between-electron-and-electron-prebuilt) for an explaination why. 

- Dependencies:
```shell
# Install dependencies prior to running
npm install
```



### Run

Run without compiling a new app:

```shell
npm start
```


### Build

Build a `Tint.app` file:

```shell
npm run package
```

### Regenerate the Icon

~~Create a new `Tint.icns` file by running the following script:~~

This will be removed in next commits as it's no longer needed..

```shell
./scripts/make-icon
```
